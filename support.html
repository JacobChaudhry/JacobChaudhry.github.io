      <h3>Our biggest factor in our growth is community. We can start with marketing and advertisement, but we are going to need direct help. By pressing the button below you will be given a copy of a script that we ask you to send to your local school districts. By getting in touch with representatives from schools directly, we are optimizing our chances of implementing more natural ways of growing and learning into school systems across the world. This may be crucial to our growth and with every message that gets sent out, we are building a community from within to cultivate children to higher stages of evolution.</h3>

Heya, 
Seed is the acronym for Self Exploration Education Design. A design that focuses on cultivating groups of individuals through meditation techniques and processes that have been proven through decades of scientific research and used for centuries in human history to provide people with heightened senses of emotional intelligence, love for their lives, overcoming traumas, inspiring ideas, sociability, physiological health, and mystical experiences. Within the education system, this can transform the capabilities of our children - by reconnecting with the neurophysiology of the heart and mind, our children can become the vehicles of wisdom they always have been and carry our world to the next stages of human development and evolution. The seed must be planted so the flower can sprout, expand, and bloom. 
The youth have and continue to be exploited of their joy and wonder through the traumas of their development. 
Increasingly in the 21st Century, we see young individuals having trouble coping with traumas whether such experiences are regarded within family challenges and abuse, wealth challenges, social inequalities, physiological disabilities, and much more. 
The outcomes of all these experiences, if not faced properly, are mental health problems where individuals have hard time doing well in school, having unhealthy diet and consumption, drug and alcohol abuse, plus inappropriate and even violent behavior. Modern schools have seen a rapant increase in such qualities of students in the last decade which seems to provide an area of disconnection within the way students are learning and growing in their youthful and adolescent years. Majority of students are not thriving in their school environments, they are just trying to survive. 
What SEED provides is a technique, a set of mental tools, to exercise the neurons (nerve cells) throughout the body to become more coherent and synchronized with the neurons in the brain. When children are functioning in a coherent balance through their physiology, they themselves are functioning coherently with optimistic personalities and motivated intentions because they are biochemically healthy and joyously conscious of who they are. 
SEED opens the doors to allow the individual to take control of their academics, personal lives, family lives, and community, because the individual will want to, through the process of meditation and visualization to recenter oneself towards a state of calm, well being, and inspiration.
Walk through this door with us. 
We have the vision of implementing SEED into 100 California schools by the end of 2023, and by 2025 we hope to reach 5000 schools across the United States. Join us on this journey to establish a seed of wonder, joy, and experience within the generations to come for the world that we deserve. 
This is more than a meditation gathering, this is a celebration and an awakening of our children.
