	 	<h2>
	 		For the last several centuries, public and private schools have focused on programming growing individuals towards the societal functions of commerce and labor through the education of several subjects generally consisting of mathematics, literature, science, and history. Schools have not taken into account how a student can maximize productivity in their academia - they rarely provide direct influence for an individual to work efficiently, work effectively, be inspired, be motivated, or be emotionally intact.

	 	<h2>
	 		Rather individuals are thrown into school to grapple with these ideas and tendencies majority on their own. Maybe this is fact because there has never been an effective technique introduced to school districts on a large scale to benefit our children. 
	 	</h2>

	 	<h2>
	 		Increasingly in the 21st Century, we see young individuals having trouble to cope with traumas whether such experiences are regarded within family challenges and abuse, wealth challenges, social inequalities, physiological disabilities, and much more. The outcome of all these experiences, if not faced properly, are mental health problems where individuals have hard time doing well in school, having unhealthy diet and consumption, drug and alcohol abuse, plus inappropriate and even violent behavior. Modern schools have seen a rapant increase in such qualities of students in the last decade which seems to provide an area of disconnection within the way students are learning and growing in their youthful and adolescent years. Majority of students are not thriving in their school environments, they are just trying to survive.
	 	</h2>

	 	<h2>
	 		The limited path of worldly understanding that school systems have provided for students ultimately have resulted in poor health, both mentally and physically. The decline in students ability to perform in academics is real, and there has to be a solution, a shift, soon before our children become slaves to the habits they have cultvated from their environment for generations on end, if that isnt the case already.
	 	</h2>

	 	<h2>
	 		What SEED provides is a technique, a set of mental tools, to exercise the neurons throughout the body to become more coherent and synchronized with the neurons in the brain. When children are functioning in a coherent balance through their physiology, they themselves are functioning coherently with optimistic personalities and motivated intentions because they are biochemically healthy and joyously conscious of who they are.
